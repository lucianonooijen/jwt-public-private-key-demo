# JWT with public/private keys (JWK)

By Luciano Nooijen

This demo uses code from [capsa-gg/capsa](https://github.com/capsa-gg/capsa).

## Disclaimer

Do NOT blindly copy this code. There are placeholders in there. Make sure to change the code to be correct for your project, unless you want all keys to have the name "John Doe".

This project is just meant as a simple demo. For example: when restarting the server, keys on the client will break with no error handling.
